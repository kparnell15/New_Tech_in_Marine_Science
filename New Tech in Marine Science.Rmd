The Summer Course started yesterday. We:
 
 - Ran over intros
 
 - Island tour
 
 - Shopping at SafeWay
 
 Here is a website Josh likes: <http://jmadinlab.org>
 
 This is how to add an equation
 $$ x^2 = \frac{y^2}{z^2} $$
 
 Here is a photo of the island and **HIMB**:

 > Figure 1: Histogram of ant heights
 
 - This is how you add your code from r into markdown
```{r}
hist(rnorm(1000))
```
 
- This is how to add the histogram without the r code on the markdown page
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(rnorm(1000))
```
